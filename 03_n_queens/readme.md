# Homework
Place N queens no NxN board, so that they are not conflicting. 

Use MinConflicts to solve this problem.

---

It should work for `N=10 000` (when solved with DFS, no solution is found for N > 100);

## Input
Integer N - the number of the queens. 

## Output
Print to the std output the board marking the queens with  `*` and empty cells with `_`
